  |   American Fugitive is a modern take on classic sandbox action          |
  |   offering a new 3D top-down open-world single-player experience.       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Welcome to Redrock County, a sleepy American town with a booming      |
  |   criminal underbelly.                                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   You take the role of Will Riley. No angel for sure - but not a        |
  |   killer. Yet the cold-blooded murder of your dad is the crime they     |
  |   locked you up for. Fuelled by grief and a burning desire for          |
  |   vengeance, you'll bust out of jail intent on finding the real         |
  |   culprit.                                                              |

  |   Once outside, you'll need to blend with the townsfolk to avoid        |
  |   recapture. Establish contact with the criminal underworld and stay    |
  |   one step ahead of the police dragnet.                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Set in the deep south of the 1980s, American Fugitive is a            |
  |   love-letter to the classic movies and games of old.                   |
